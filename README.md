# An Average Day in Customer Service

This excerise serves to describe the daily experience of working in any field of customer service. You will encounter horrid customers, you will be called names, and you will be treated as a vessle that serves only to attain unattainable expectations. 

Your efforts with these customers are seen as worthless to them, but you are given the freedom to be the bigger person regardless. 

<i>*This project utilizes the Open API generation server. It was created using p5.js.</i>

## Instructions
- Press the <strong> "Start" </strong> button on the bottom left corner. 
  - This will generate a rude remark you have receieved from a customer. 
- You have three options for your response: <strong> Bite Back, Be the Bigger Person, or Play Dumb. </strong>
  - Once you select a response category, your response will be generated. 
- You are also free choose another response category, if the generated response does not satisfy you. 
- To regenerate another customer remark, press the <strong> "Start" </strong> button. 

## Further Expansion
For future reference, I would like to incorporate different kinds of customer experiences as well. For example, I would incorporate options such as:
- "Happy Customer" 
- "Dumb Customer" 
- "Rude Customer" 
- "Surprise Me" 

Additionally, I would like to later expand on the color coordination of the final product based on the customer choice. For example:
- Rude = Red
- Happy = Green
- Dumb = Purple

Enjoy!
